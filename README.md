### 2. Problem Statement
Our problem statement would be to find out what are the common trends in job listings. With the difficulties in the job market, both job seekers and recruiters are facing challenges. To begin with, job seekers are facing a problem where they look at job titles, when they should be evaluating their skills first. Ideally, the candidates should assess the skills they possess and match them with job postings. However, in many cases, job seekers search for a job title on job boards and send in job applications. 


Recruiters are having similar problems as well. They often use job titles that attract more job seekers when they should have more descriptive job titles. Instead, they should be using job titles that describe the job scopes. Therefore, with an overwhelming number of job applications, recruiters would eventually dedicate less time for each applicant. 


By knowing important keywords that companies are looking out for in resumes, job seekers will have an easier time getting past hiring filters (The Straits Times, 2020). Moreover, with great demand for employers with extensive skill sets, it is important for job seekers to understand their worth, and how much typical employees in the role are earning. This can be valuable data knowledge for job seekers, as knowing an average pay range would help them in negotiating salaries.


As soon-to-be graduates ourselves, we find this problem to be meaningful in helping students like us in their future job search. Hence this project aims to explore what are the popular job skills required for various job scopes, as well as to identify the various pay scales that certain job roles would have.
